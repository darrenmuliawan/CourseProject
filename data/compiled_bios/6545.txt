I am involved in several ongoing projects in such areas as systems for large-scale ML, cloud/cluster resource scheduling, and exploitation of new storage/NVM technologies. Big-learning systems for Big Data Modern data analytics often relies on statistical machinelearning (ML) to parameterize models that fit observation data,for use in making predictions, correlating causes with effects, etc.Growth in data and desired model precision dictate parallel execution ofML algorithms on clusters, with the corresponding work distribution,synchronization, and data consistency challenges. The big-learning groupis exploring powerful new approaches forefficient, scalable, and robust big-learning on Big Data. Cloud Computing We are exploring software systems challenges in efficiently supporting and exploiting cloud computing, such as resource allocation/scheduling and exploiting elasticity for stateful services (e.g., storage) and long-running computations (e.g., large-scale ML). Parallel Data Lab (PDL) As Director of the Parallel Data Lab, I lead and collaborate on a number of storage-related projects in areas such as storage system architecture, file systems, and Big Data systems. For example, in addition to the activities discussed above, we are exploring how system software should change to accommodate new storage technologies like non-volatile RAM (e.g., PCM) and best exploit Flash.
