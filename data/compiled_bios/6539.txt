Accountability in Big Data Systems/Machine Learning A specific focus is on accountability in big data systems that employ machine learning. We are developing theories and tools that can be used to provide oversight of complex information processing ecosystems (including big data systems) to ensure that they respect privacy, and other desirable values in the personal data protection area, such as fairness and transparency. This includes foundations, methods, and tools for detection of violations, explanations for decisions by machine learning systems, attribution or responsibility-assignment for the violations, and correction of responsible entities to avoid future violations. The technical work is informed by and applied to significant practical privacy problems in a broad range of sectors, including Web and healthcare privacy. Significant recent results include the following: Algorithmic transparency via Quantitative Input Influence -- an approach to measuring causal influence of features on decisions of a machine learnt classifier [IEEE S & P 2016] The first statistically rigorous methodology forinformation flow experimentsto discover personal data use by black-box Web services [CSF 2015]. The AdFisher tool that implements an augmented version of this methodology to enable discovery at scale; and its application in the first study to demonstrate statististically significant evidence of discrimination in online behavioral advertising [PETS 2015] (see also theFAQ on this study and AdFisher) The firstautomated privacy compliance analysis of the production code of an Internet-scale system-- the big data analytics pipeline for Bing, Microsoft's search engine; leverages our usable privacy policy language called Legalease, and an information flow analysis methodology (joint work with Microsoft Research) [IEEE S & P 2014] The first complete logical specification of all disclosure-related clauses of theHIPAA Privacy Rulefor healthcare privacy [WPES2010] andaudit algorithmsthat apply to it and, more generally, to a rich class of policies (fragments of metric first-order temporal logic) [CCS 2011,CAV 2014,CCS 2015] The first formal semantics forpurpose restrictions on information useand associated audit algorithms[IEEE S & P 2012,ESORICS 2013] A formalization ofprivacy as contextual integrity[IEEE S & P 2006] (see also the White House'sConsumer Privacy Bill of Rights) Search Terms Find Graduate Advisors by Name - Advisors - Acar, Umut Aldrich, Jonathan Amvrosiadis, George Andersen, David Balcan, Nina Beckmann, Nathan Blelloch, Guy Brookes, Stephen Brumley, David Chen, Tianqi Crane, Keenan Crary, Karl Datta, Anupam Erdmann, Michael Faloutsos, Christos Fanti, Giulia Fredrikson, Matt Frieze, Alan Ganger, Greg Garlan, David Gibbons, Phillip Gligor, Virgil Goldstein, Seth Goyal, Vipul Gupta, Anupam Guruswami, Venkatesan Haeupler, Bernhard Harchol-Balter, Mor Harper, Robert Heule, Marijn Hodgins, Jessica Hoffmann, Jan Jia, Limin Kanade, Takeo Kolter, J.
